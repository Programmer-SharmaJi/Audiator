# üí´  About Me:

* Voice assistants are programs on digital devices that listen and respond to verbal commands. A user can say, What‚Äôs the weather and the voice assistant will answer with the weather report for that day and location. They could say, tell me a joke, and the assistant will jump into a tale. The user could even say, play music, and song will be played! Voice assistants are so easy to use that many people forget to stop and wonder how they work.

* Voice assistants, such as Siri and Google Assistant, are digital programs that understand and respond to spoken instructions.
* They are versatile, and capable of providing weather updates, telling jokes, and playing music, among other tasks.
* Contrary to magic or complex coding, voice assistants rely on user-friendly interfaces and established technology.
* These interfaces are designed to be minimal and self-explanatory, making them accessible to users.
* The methods used for voice assistants involve measuring the outcomes of voice commands executed by the computer, typically implemented through programming in languages like Java.
* Limitations include difficulties in accurately processing certain user speech and the inability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
* In summary, voice assistants offer a hands-free way for users to interact with their digital devices, enhancing convenience and accessibility in various tasks.

## ‚û¢  FAQs
A list of frequently asked questions
FAQ 1: How do voice assistants understand what we're saying?

Answer: Voice assistants use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to convert spoken words into text. Then, Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms analyze the text to understand the user's intent and provide relevant responses.

FAQ 2: Are voice assistants always listening to our conversations?

Answer: No, voice assistants are designed to activate only when they hear specific wake words or phrases (e.g., "Hey Siri" or "Alexa"). They continuously listen for these trigger words, but they don't actively record or process conversations until they are activated.
